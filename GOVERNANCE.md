## Governance of the Humanity WordPress Theme and Plugins 
This document defines the project governance for the governance of the Humanity WordPress Theme and Plugins with the aim to give the community a better understanding of how decisions are made.  

### Overview
We are starting by opening our source code and working in the open, with the emphasis on transparency and giving back, we aim to improve collaboration over time.  
The Amnesty International International Secretariat (AIIS) Web Operations team will continue to plan the roadmap which is implemented by and collaborated on with our partner agency Big Bite (BB). This road map is consulted on internally with AIIS departments and Amnesty Sections, but we have no plans to consult any wider for the time being.   
Decisions on what is built and when, and what makes it into a release and when, is made by AIIS and BB alone.  

### Contributing 
You are welcome to fork our theme, child theme or plugins and you are welcome to contribute as per the [contributor guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  

### Updates to this document 
We hope to update this document after 6 months of being open source, when we may be in the position to provide more guidance here. Any changes to the governance will be made by AIIS and our partner agency BB.
