#### NGOs and Nonprofit Organisations   

We encourage our colleagues at other nonprofit organizations to use and build upon the Humanity Theme.  
Since the project was initially set up to help teams across the global Amnesty International movement, it meets many of the unique requirements for grassroots campaigning organizations.  
If you work for a nonprofit and have any questions about the Humanity Theme, you can contact @carolinejcourtney.  


### Expectations   

We have a long-term arrangement with our supplier Big Bite, who are our partners in delivering this WordPress product for the foreseeable future.  
For more info see our [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) file.  

Big Bite work with many WordPress developers globally that are already using this theme, and are responsible for making sure any code meets our requirements and standards.  
Working with us will not lead to any paid work, and there is no guarantee code written will be used.  
All contributors whose code makes it into production will be mentioned at our discretion; we will not publish anything or provide any back links etc.  

We look forward to collaborating with you in the future! If you have any questions, you can contact us at website[at]amnesty.org.
